# 📡 RadioRCA
**Telecom Root Cause Analysis Framework**

A specialized Python framework for Telecom Root Cause Analysis (RCA). This tool automates the ingestion of Performance Management (PM), Configuration (CM), and Site Design data into a structured archive for analysis.

RadioRCA is designed to bridge the gap between messy network exports and actionable insights. It handles multi-vendor CSV inconsistencies, standardizes decimals/separators, and maintains a dual-archive system to ensure data integrity.
